# Setup a new project

**Note**: In the future I will add a `create-naest-app` command to make it easier to setup a new project.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14.15.4 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6.14.10 or higher)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Knowledge with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the project is written in TypeScript only
- Knowledge with [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Knowledge with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Knowledge with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) & [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

## Cloning the project

To setup a new project with Naest, you can clone the repository from GitHub and install the dependencies. Make sure to remove the `.git` folder and reinitialize it if you don't want to use the existing repositories commit history.

```bash
# clone from github
git clone https://github.com/bdbch/naest.git

# remove the .git folder and reinitialize it
rm -rf .git
git init

# install dependencies
npm install
```
