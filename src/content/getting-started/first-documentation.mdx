# Creating your first documentation

After cloning and setting up your project via the instructions found [here](/getting-started/setup-a-new-project), you can start creating your first documentation. In this guide we'll go through the following steps:

1. Create a new page
2. Add content to the page
3. Add the page to the navigation
4. Add frontmatter data for metadata

## 1. Create a new page

Creating a new page is as easy as creating a new file in the `src/content` directory. Just create a new `.mdx` file with the name of your page.
For this example we'll create a new file called `about.mdx` in our `src/content` directory.

```bash
touch src/content/about.mdx
```

You should now find your new file in the `src/content` directory and in your browser by opening `http://localhost:3000/about`.

## 2. Add content to the page

You can now open the newly created `about.mdx` file and add some content to it. You can use markdown syntax to format your content.

```mdx
# About my documentation

Hello world! **This** is my first documentation page.
You can read more about me on [my website](https://my-website.dev)
```
