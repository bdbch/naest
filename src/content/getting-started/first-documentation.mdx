# Creating your first documentation

After cloning and setting up your project via the instructions found [here](/getting-started/setup-a-new-project), you can start creating your first documentation. In this guide we'll go through the following steps:

1. Create a new page
2. Add content to the page
3. Add the page to the navigation
4. Add frontmatter data for metadata

## 1. Create a new page

Creating a new page is as easy as creating a new file in the `src/content` directory. Just create a new `.mdx` file with the name of your page.
For this example we'll create a new file called `about.mdx` in our `src/content` directory.

```bash
touch src/content/about.mdx
```

You should now find your new file in the `src/content` directory and in your browser by opening `http://localhost:3000/about`.

## 2. Add content to the page

You can now open the newly created `about.mdx` file and add some content to it. You can use markdown syntax to format your content.

```mdx
# About my documentation

Hello world! **This** is my first documentation page.
You can read more about me on [my website](https://my-website.dev)
```

## 3. Add the page to the navigation

After creating the page and adding content to it, you can add it to the sidebar navigation. To do this, open the `src/content/sitebar.ts` where you will find the existing configuration for your sidebar.
This sidebar file is automatically consumed by naest and will be able to be rendered in your application. By default this is done in the `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` file.

```ts
// imports the necessary types
import { SidebarConfig } from "@/types";

// define the sidebar configuration
// a sidebar configuration consists of an array of sidebar
// categories that contain an array of sidebar items
const config: SidebarConfig = [
  {
    items: [
      {
        title: "Naest",
        path: "/",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Getting started",
    items: [
      {
        title: "Setup a new project",
        path: "/getting-started/setup-a-new-project",
      },
      {
        title: "Creating your first documentation",
        path: "/getting-started/first-documentation",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Advanced",
    items: [
      {
        title: "Configuring Sidebars",
        path: "/advanced/sidebars",
      },
      {
        title: "Using MDX",
        path: "/advanced/using-mdx",
      },
    ],
  },
];

export default config;
```

Lets add a new category called `About the project` into the sidebar configuration and add the `about` page to it.

```ts
// imports the necessary types
import { SidebarConfig } from "@/types";

// define the sidebar configuration
// a sidebar configuration consists of an array of sidebar
// categories that contain an array of sidebar items
const config: SidebarConfig = [
  // ...
  {
    title: "About the project",
    items: [
      {
        title: "About",
        path: "/about",
      },
    ],
  },
];

export default config;
```

Great job! Now you should see the new category in the sidebar with the `About` page.

## 4. Add frontmatter data for metadata

The last thing that is missing from your new page is meta data that can be used to display additional information about the page. This can be done by adding frontmatter data to the top of your `.mdx` file.

```mdx
---
title: "About my documentation"
description: "This is my first documentation page"
---
```

Read more about metadata in our [advanced metadata guide](/advanced/metadata).
