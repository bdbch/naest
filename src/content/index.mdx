# Welcome to Naest

Naest is a simple, Next.js-based `static site generator` that uses MDX for content. It's designed to be a simple, flexible, and fast way to create a static site documentations.

## Motivation

I developed Naest to provide a straightforward yet adaptable solution for building static site documentations using Next. While there are several other static site generators available,
such as [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), I was motivated to build my own to deepen my understanding of Next.js and MDX and explore different methods for managing data within a Next application.

### What is the difference to Nextra?

The primary distinction between Nextra and Naest is that Nextra is described as a **theme**, whereas Naest is a **template**.
This difference is crucial because Nextra is designed primarily to theme your content, whereas Naest is built to be extended and customized to suit your specific requirements.
Although Nextra can also be customized, Naest maintains a project structure that closely aligns with a standard Next App Router setup.

## What still needs to be worked on? Here's the list:

- **Automatic OG images** - Planning to simplify sharing on social media by adding automatic OG images.
- **Versioning** - Aiming to introduce a versioning system for streamlined version management of documentations.
- **Changelogs** - Looking to automatically pull changelogs from Github to keep the documentation up-to-date.
- **i18n (Internationalization)** - I'm working on adding support for multiple languages to reach a wider audience.
- **Search functionality** - I intend to implement search functionality to help users easily navigate and find content.
- **Project scaffolding** - I'm creating a `create-naest-app` command to simplify the setup process for new projects.
- **Auto-optimized assets** - Planning to incorporate automatic asset optimization to enhance the loading speed of the site.
- **Light mode** - Although I initially focused on dark mode, Iâ€™m now looking to include a light mode option as well.

## Who are the maintainers of Naest?

- **[bdbch](https://github.com/bdbch)** - Currently sole maintainer of Naest.
