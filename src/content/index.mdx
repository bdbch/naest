# Welcome to Naest

Naest is a simple, Next.js-based `static site generator` that uses MDX for content. It's designed to be a simple, flexible, and fast way to create a static site documentations.

## Motivation

I created Naest because I wanted a simple but flexible way to create static site documentations with Next. I know there are many other static site generators out there (for example [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/)),
but I wanted to create my own to learn more about Next.js and MDX and play around with ways to parse data around in an Next application.

### What is the difference to Nextra?

Nextra is a great Next template for documentations and blogs. I think the biggest difference to Naest is, that Nextra is using the page router and is a lot more opionionated in terms of design and structure.
I think Naest is a bit more flexible in terms of design and structure, but can also a bit more complex to use.

## What still needs to be worked on?

- **Code highlighting** - I want to add code highlighting to the template to make it easier to read code snippets.
- **Code snippets** - Make it easier to copy code snippets.
- **Project scaffolding** - I want to add a `create-naest-app` command to make it easier to setup a new project.
- **Search functionality** - I want to add a search functionality to the template to make it easier to find content.
- **Light mode** - I built the template with a dark mode in mind, but I want to add a light mode as well.
- **i18n** - I want to add internationalization to the template to make it easier to create multilingual documentations.
- **Versioning** - I want to add a versioning system to the template to make it easier to create versioned documentations.
