# Welcome to Naest

Naest is a simple, Next.js-based `static site generator` that uses MDX for content. It's designed to be a simple, flexible, and fast way to create a static site documentations.

## Motivation

I created Naest because I wanted a simple but flexible way to create static site documentations with Next. I know there are many other static site generators out there (for example [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/)),
but I wanted to create my own to learn more about Next.js and MDX and play around with ways to parse data around in an Next application.

### What is the difference to Nextra?

Nextra is a great Next template for documentations and blogs. I think the biggest difference to Naest is, that Nextra is using the page router and is a lot more opionionated in terms of design and structure.
I think Naest is a bit more flexible in terms of design and structure, but can also a bit more complex to use.
